# From Dev To DevOps Wizard

## About

In here, you will find all the content related to the `From Dev to DevOps Wizard` course on [Egghead](http://egghead.io) by [Joel Lord](http://twitter.com/joel__lord).

## Description

You've been told that you now need to deploy your applications on Kubernetes but where do you get started? You've come to the right place. Kubernetes can be very intimidating at first. Especially if you aren't used to containers. 

In this course, you will learn the basics of Docker container and see how you can use those skills to prepare your application to be deployed in the cloud. 

In the second part of the course, we will focus more on Kubernetes and how you can deploy the containers you're now capable of creating, into that platform.

This course is divided in two different major parts. The first one focuses on containers (more specifically Docker containers), while the second part is really focused on Kubernetes.

## What you'll learn

* What is a container
* How to use containers locally
* Connecting containers together in a local environment
* Building your own images
* Use Docker-compose to create local environments

* Basic Kubernetes building blocks
* Exposing your application
* Persisting data
* Deploy microservices
* Create Cron Jobs

## Prerequisites

This course doesn't have any prerequisites. 

The code samples are in JavaScript so it can be useful (but not necessary) to have some basic general knowledge of the language.

Most of this course will focus on command line instructions so basic knowledge of Unix command lines is useful but not a requirement. Instructions that are not as common will be explained as we encounter them.

All examples will run in a Linux operating system. They have been tested successfully on Mac OS. Everything should also work when using the WSL under Windows.
